# Self-Evaluation

- Reflect on your learning and work today. What are you most proud of?
Earlier on in the methods lesson, I kind of fell behind. This led to a little bit of a panic. Luckily, when we went to our break out groups, I had some great assistance from my group and the instructor. I went back to the lesson plan and reread it. Upon taking the CFU, I felt very confident in my code and I feel like my understanding of the subject matter went from nil to proficient.

- What is the power of using methods in our applications?
Methods are great for commonly occuring issues in code. If you have to repeat an action over and over again, creating a method will help streamline your effort and it can be used as many times as needed.
